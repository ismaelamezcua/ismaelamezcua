### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer scientist and software engineer with experience in architecting and developing software in areas ranging from embedded to full-stack web applications. I have a deep understanding of networking protocols, Cloud computing, service provisioning, and system hardening. I earned my bachelor's degree from Universidad de Colima, and my master's from TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, a top 200 worldwide ranked university. Both in computer science. I am conversant in the English language.
